## Overview

Use this guide to install the N-Sight RMM agent on Linux servers.

## Installation Steps

#### **Step 1:** Download the agent from N-Sight.

---

#### **Step 2:** Upload the `rmmagent-2.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm` installation package to the `/opt` directory on the SLES server and install it using:

```bash
rpm -ivh rmmagent-2.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm
```

#### **Step 3:** Ensure that the agentâ€™s service is started (the service should start automatically following installation):

```bash
systemctl status rmmagent
```

#### **Step 4:** Execute the `rmmagentd` script located under `/usr/local/rmmagent` to register the agent:

```bash
/usr/local/rmmagent/rmmagentd register
```

#### **Step 5:** Enter your N-Sight credentials (username and password). Only certain staff have the permissions to register servers in N-Sight. Check with The NOC Team Manager to confirm your account's permissions.

#### **Step 6:** Select the customer by entering the client number. For example, enter `73` if you are installing the agent for Richmond Defence Systems.
