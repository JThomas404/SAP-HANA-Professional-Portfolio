# SAP HANA Professional Portfolio

This portfolio showcases a curated collection of folders containing [**Guides**](./Guides/), [**Implementation KBAs**](./Implementation/), and [**Professional Projects**](./Projects/) for **SAP HANA (Linux) servers**.

These resources were originally developed during my time at **SEIDOR Networks** for internal use and hands-on work in real SAP HANA environments.
