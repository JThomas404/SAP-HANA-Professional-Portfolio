## Script: `newghrepo.sh`
The `newghrepo.sh` script automates the process of creating a new GitHub repository and pushing local files to it. It simplifies repository setup by combining Git initialisation, GitHub API integration, and remote configuration into a single script.

### Features:
- Creates a `README.md` file with the repository name.
- Initialises a local Git repository and makes the first commit.
- Uses the GitHub API to create a new repository on GitHub.
- Configures the remote repository and pushes the local files to GitHub.

### Usage:
1. Set your GitHub username and personal access token in the script:
    ```sh
    GITHUB_USER="YourGitHubUsername"
    GITHUB_TOKEN="YourPersonalAccessToken"
